Solus, A very pretty OS based on newer Linux kernels ( As of writing 4.7.X ) with quite a sexy desktop environment called Budgie.

Installing Solus was super simple after booting from the USB, Next next next select drive finish simple. The only issues that bugged me was at least from my memory on installing it theirs not a whole lot of settings you can freely edit from within the installer. The issue though not being a big one as all you have todo in that case is edit them after but adding things like a better partition editor or just allowing/forcing you to set more settings for your computer would be nice.

Upon rebooting i was greeted with the login screen, This was a nice sight as the last few distros/OSes I've been trying have all failed or had major issues on their first boot so this is a big +1 in my book for their automated installer. After i updated the system and installed nvidia drivers then rebooted everything just worked which again might just be but it's always nice to see distros just work when they say they will.

Now the desktop, It has a very Deepin X KDE Plasma feel to it. It also feels very polished, By that i mean it feels smooth everything matches unlike some distros default DEs. Specking of how polished something feels. PiSi the package manager for Solus feels quite unpolished and young, Now what do i mean by that? i mean that while it is missing several packages i normally install upon getting a new distro where missing or named something completely different now the naming i can excuse but the fact that i used PiSi to install GCC GCC-C++ and it still couldn't compile anything sums it up perfectly. Now i may just be missing something but after checking the Solus wiki and finding nothing to help me makes me feel that their is still lots of work to be done for this distro.

So with all that being said would i recommend it? Well yes, it is perfect for people who want a light pretty desktop with Libreoffice and Firefox aka the perfect general school distro for most people. As for me using it again? I'm not sure if i will I'll Definitely keep an eye on it's development as i can see Solus being very very useful once some of those bugs are flushed and more packages are added to the repos but before that point i can't see myself using it again.
