Trying a new Distro can be slightly scary like jumping from Arch Linux to Void Linux as those two have different well everything so you end up having to relearn a lot of stuff. Thankfully this was not the case with ElementaryOS  as it is an Ubuntu fork so if you've used Ubuntu in the past switching to ElementaryOS is super simple and you'll get the hang of it quickly. On the topic on switching lets talk about the install process..or the button press simulator! Installing felt just like Ubuntu. Except for one key thing. Every window had an advanced option to let you customize your install beyond the Y/N options that you normally see in installers. This on top of the fact that it installed using UEFI and as of the time of writing this, this is the only installer I've seen do this. The only down side of the installer for me is the fact that it wasn't able to auto restart my machine after install as to why I'm still not sure but a forced shutdown later and everything was up and running!

Once you finish creating your user on first boot you'll be greeted with a pleasant GNOME3 / MacOS ~isk desktop called Pantheon. Pantheon seems like a great DE in my week I've had no issues with it and it's quite snappy, the one issue I've ran into with it though is pinning other programs to the lower dock without having to make a .desktop file entry for it ( Although it should be known that lots of distros have this issue but that's still not en excuse. ). Then when you go to update your system as the 1.4~ GB ISO is almost guaranteed out of date you'll be greeted by APT! Using the Ubuntu repos. You may or may not like this but i see it as a plus as the Ubuntu repos i find are quite well built and since Ubuntu is such a widely used OS their are mirrors everywhere allowing super quick downloads! 

Upon digging deeper i found that ElementaryOS version 0.4.0 is based on Ubuntu 16.04 using the kernel from Ubuntu too ( 4.4.X ), This also means it's using GCC 5.4.0 again this can be good or bad depending on your use case but i see it as a good thing as GCC 6.X is still giving me issues compiling some projects. Another plus for ElementaryOS in my books is the lack of any ToS.

So in ending I'd almost go as far to say I'd recommend it over Vanilla Ubuntu as to what's holding me back I'm not sure. perhaps it's the over all lack of huge extra features besides the DE? As i said i can't quite put my finger on it but ElementaryOS in my books is still one i could see myself personally using as a stable daily driver on a work machine.
