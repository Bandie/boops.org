**Switching from Arch to Gentoo**

If you use [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) then you can probably guess why i did. It's fast, light weight with huge repos with (if you include [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/)) most likely has every package you could ever want also throwing in the fact that it's a rolling release those packages are almost always bleeding edge or right next to it.

You might be thinking at this point "Well if you like Arch so much why would you switch away from it?" and to that my reply is because it's fun. Yes distro hopping can be a pain and yes re downloading everything i use is pretty annoying it is still fun. It's fun because of the new challenges that a new distro will pose for you a few examples being new install method, different package manager, different system initializer, etc etc this again might make you think "well isn't that a pain to relearn everything again and again endlessly?" the simple answer to that being you're not. as every time you use a new package manager, install method you'll learn how that works and compare it to the last method you used to install from there I'm not sure if this goes for everyone but in my case it helps me understand what I'm doing to my machine and how it affects it a little more each time as well as learning a little more on how specific programs function such as fdisk.

Now with all that being said why specifically did i choose [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/). As you might be able to guess from the paragraph above deeper control Gentoo is an distro that you compile EVERYTHING from source no pre built packages no pre built kernel. Yes this does mean it takes a long time to even get to the desktop (In my case 5~ hours to get into plasma) however this also gives Gentoo the befit of efficiency that meaning when you compile a specific package or even the kernel for this matter you only compile and setup exactly what you need. This also has the less seen benefit of teaching you how the Linux kernel works and in Gentoo's case how packages are compiled.
