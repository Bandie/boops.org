Trisquel 7, An Ubuntu 14.04 Based distro based that uses the Linux-libre kernel version 3.13.X. This fact alot with it's own repos that use APT make Trisquel a special Linux distro. It uses GNOME3 flash back as it's default desktop environment with other lighter one available along with a minimal net install image if you with to build your own even lighter version. 

On my first attempt at installing Trisquel i was greeted by a voice talking reading out all the text on the screen, This scared the crap out of me as the volume defaulted to 50%. Other then that the install went smoothly as it uses the Ubuntu 14.04 installer so it is pretty polished. The one issue i encountered and this is most likely my hardware that is to blame as my SSD that i install is one SDC instead of SDA but a quick edit in the partition menu and that was solved.

On my first boot it failed the boot onto the desktop but after flipping to tty1 fully updating and rebooting everything worked fine after that. The next "issue"? I can't really call it an issue as it's doing what is was designed to do but this was a problem for me as i use some non-free software ( I'm sorry! ) such as the Nvidia driver, Virtual Box and a few others but as the software repo only contains free software you are stuck manually installing these. But once their installed you will have no issues running them.

As i stated in the previous paragraph i only have two real problems with Trisquel. The first as i said it can be annoying to install non-free software but remember this is by design. And the other is since it is based on Ubuntu 14.04 the repos are quite dated as Trisquel uses GCC 4.8.4 no Java 8, Eclipse is using a very old version. Besides those points their are really no giant issues i see with Trisquel and in contrast to those since Trisquel is 100% free ( As in freedom ) you know their are no back doors in your system and nothing you can't not fix or modify yourself this while not sounding like a huge deal really is, As any software you cannot fully read and modify yourself limits you to what the developers decide you can do instead of as in the case of fully free software where they only suggest what you can do or use it with. This along with if you find a bug in the software you can try and fix it yourself instead of hoping one day the developers will notice your issue and fix it.

So overall would i suggest or use Trisquel again? Well if it's going to be my workstation PC no same applies for suggestions in this case. Although if it is going onto a mobile machine like a laptop or an X86 tablet then i can see it's use as on those devices you most likely don't do anything beyond browse the internet, Check email perhaps edit a doc and all of those can be easily accomplished with Trisquel. While also knowing that your PC is truly under your and only your control.
