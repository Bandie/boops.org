It's distro hopping time again but i must say i was kinda sad to move away from Void as that was quite fun to learn about plus void was pretty stable for being a bleeding edge rolling release but time goes on and i decided to try Antergos now because i don't read that much about a distro before switching to it as it's more fun to just jump and go for it it hit me as a surprise that Antergos was just a fancy installer for Arch Linux whoa. Now this is far from a bad thing as arch is also a very good and the only one that could out rank void for me as Arch has the AUR making packages that somehow not included in the repos super easy to install not to mention if you have Pacaur then it turns into one command! As i noticed this fact that i was now installing a pre-configured version of Arch on my PC i was kinda angry no not at the fact that it was an installer for arch and no not that it was pre-configured but by the fact that no one ever mentioned this distro to me back when i was using Arch a few weeks ago i must have spent a good two to four hours trying to find all the fonts i was missing and still never did if i might add! But putting all that aside Antergos as it stands right now is a great installer for Arch as it lets you choose your desktop environment installs all the fonts you'll need to get started (Yes they're still some missing but they are Japanese fonts so i can't really fault them for not installing those) and i'm happy i did decide to try it as next time i install Arch I'll most likely be using Antergos again!
