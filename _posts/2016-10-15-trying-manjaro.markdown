Manjaro, a pleasant distro based on Arch that comes with several different desktop flavors, Since it is based on Arch you might have been able to guess that it is bleeding edge and uses that latest versions of packages available.

Installing Manjaro is super simple just point to the drive you want it installed on and spam next. But be warned as this threw me the first time Manjaro from live USB does take quite a while to boot as in 1-3 Minutes but once it does the live environment is nice and smooth!

Upon first boot into to my newly installed GNOME environment i did the usual and ran an upgrade then rebooted but after that i was unable to log back into GNOME for some reason and after an hour or so playing with it i reinstalled using XFCE and it handled it all perfectly!

The XFCE environment comes nicely setup with several features baked in such as a GUI based package manager and a nice dark theme by default. The desktop also comes with several pre-installed apps beyond what you usually see included, Including steam which stood out to me the most for being an odd app to include by default. All of the other pre installed apps are the ones you would be used to seeing such as libre office, Disk writer, GIMP, Firefox ect, ect.

Now one of the coolest things I've seen in a distro in a while is a kernel version picker. As the name implies it allows you to choose what kernel you'd like to run and proceeds to reinstall any kernel specific apps such as the graphics drivers for that version. Beyond that it feels just like Arch as it uses pacman as the bleeding edge of package versions.

So would i recommend this to people? Yes, since it is based on Arch that allows you to use the Arch wiki for issues the Manjaro forums/IRC seem quite active and it really gives off the Ubuntu feeling of i work great with a GUI but you can also use the command line if you wish. That in my eyes makes it perfect for people just starting with Linux! As for would i use it again? I can see myself installing this on a laptop that i use daily as it is made so you don't have to use the command line which is perfect for those lazy days when i only feel like clicking. So overall i do like Manjaro and can see where it tries to fit and as of the time of writing this seems to be fitting quite well!
