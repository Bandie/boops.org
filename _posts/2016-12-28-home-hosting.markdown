The RPI pictured above is what is serving up this blog!

Ah, home hosting how i got my first taste of of running what goes into the work behind the services we all use everyday. I feel like I've looped as i started hosting everything from home to pushing everything to it's own VPS back to home hosting some items although now it has become much more fun as I've learned over time and slowly expanded my home network into something that can securely host something like this blog my own personal MediaWiki and a few other services that I've not finished yet but will be attempting to deploy.
