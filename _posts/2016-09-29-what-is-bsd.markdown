Let's start with some history, BSD or ( Berkeley Software Distribution ) started it's life in 1977 as Berkeley Unix a fork of Unix developed by Computer Systems Research Group at University of California, Berkeley. During it's life as Berkeley Unix the Unix kernel was slowly replaced with software that the developers working on it had written for it. This trend continued from version to version up until version 4.4, Or the last release of BSD in this last release their where two sub versions of BSD a lite version containing no Unix code at all and an Encumbered version that still contained some bits of Unix code. This is where the modern versions of BSD come from most notability FreeBSD, NetBSD these two versions of the original BSD are forks of the original BSD version 4.4 lite. 

Now that you know some of the background of BSD think about GNU/Linux, Not just the Linux kernel but the whole system like Bash, Make, GCC, Tar Etc Etc.. FreeBSD for example replaces all of this. Making it not only use a different kernel as some people ( Me! ) thought but all the tools and even how you interact with the system, Again using FreeBSD here instead of Bash & GCC it uses tcsh and clang.
